<p>Drag and drop the linked text below into your bookmarks bar to create the spacer bookmarklet.<br/>
    This will allow you to temporarily have multiple tabs, allowing the exploit to work.<br/>
    <a href="javascript:onbeforeunload=()=>0">Spacer</a><br/>
    You should also bookmark this page.</p>
<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<p>
    Keep this page enabled and open on the <strong>right side</strong> of all of your tabs, or whichever tabs you want
    to protect.<br/>
    If you get tab limited and didn't have this tab open, or it didn't activate while the tabs were closing, follow the
    steps below:<br/>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Open this page, as well as enough other tabs to completely fill your tab limit.</p>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Right-click on your spacer bookmarklet and select "Open in new tab"</p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>Enable this tab, then drag it to the right of all of your tabs.</p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p>Try to open a new tab, and when it asks you if you want to close this tab, select "Cancel"</p>
<h4>Step 5:</h4>
<p>The exploit is now active. No matter where this tab is or how many tabs you have open, as long as this tab is open
    the tab limit will be disabled.</p>
